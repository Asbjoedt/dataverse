### Initial Support for Dataset Types (Dataset, Software, Workflow)

Datasets now have types. By default the dataset type will be "dataset" but if you turn on support for additional types, datasets can have a type of "software" or "workflow" as well. For more details see doc/sphinx-guides/source/user/dataset-types.rst and #10517. Please note that this feature is highly experimental.
