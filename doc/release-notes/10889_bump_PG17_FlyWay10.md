This release bumps both the Postgres JDBC driver and Flyway versions. This should better support Postgres version 17, and as of version 10 Flyway no longer requires a paid subscription to support older versions of Postgres.

While we don't encourage the use of older Postgres versions, this flexibility may benefit some of our long-standing installations in their upgrade paths.
