The functionality of the OIDC Bearer token API authentication (available through a feature flag) has been extended to allow the registration of new users in Dataverse when there is no user account associated with the bearer token. Specifically, a new endpoint (users/register) has been implemented, to which the bearer token and user information are sent, allowing the identity provider user to be linked to a Dataverse account.
