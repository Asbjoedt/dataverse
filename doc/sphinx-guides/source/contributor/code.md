## Welcome!

We love code contributions. Developers are not limited to the main Dataverse code in this git repo. You can help with API {doc}`/api/client-libraries` in your favorite language or create a new library. You can help work on configuration management code that's mentioned in the {doc}`/installation/index`. See {doc}`/api/external-tools` for how you can create your own tool that is available from within an installation of Dataverse.

If you are interested in working on the main Dataverse code, great! Before you start coding, please reach out to us either on the [dataverse-community Google Group][], the [dataverse-dev Google Group][], [chat.dataverse.org][], or via <support@dataverse.org> to make sure the effort is well coordinated and we avoid merge conflicts. We maintain a list of [community contributors][] and [dev efforts][] the community is working on so please let us know if you'd like to be added or removed from either list.

## Making a Pull Request

Please read {doc}`/developers/version-control` in the Developer Guide to understand how we use the "git flow" model of development and how we will encourage you to create a GitHub issue (if it doesn't exist already) to associate with your pull request. That page also includes tips on making a pull request.

After making your pull request, your goal should be to help it advance through our kanban board at <https://github.com/orgs/IQSS/projects/34> . If no one has moved your pull request to the code review column in a timely manner, please reach out. Note that once a pull request is created for an issue, we'll remove the issue from the board so that we only track one card (the pull request).

Thanks for your contribution!
