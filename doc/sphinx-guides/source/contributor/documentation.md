# Writing Documentation

Thank you for your interest in contributing documentation to Dataverse! Good documentation is absolutely critical to the success of a software project.

## Where the Source Files Live

The source for the documentation is in the main "dataverse" GitHub repo under the "[doc][]" folder.

[doc]: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/tree/develop/doc/sphinx-guides/source

## Tools

The {doc}`/developers/documentation` section of the Developer Guide has, for a long time, been the primary place to find information about the tools we use to write docs. We may move some of that content here, but until then, please visit that page.

## Writing Style Guidelines

Please observe the following when writing documentation:

- Use American English spelling.
- Use examples when possible.
- Break up longer paragraphs.
- Use "double quotes" instead of 'single quotes'.
- Favor "and" (data and code) over slashes (data/code).
