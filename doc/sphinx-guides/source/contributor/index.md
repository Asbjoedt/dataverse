## Documentation

The source for the documentation is in the GitHub repo under the "[doc][]" folder. If you find a typo or inaccuracy or something to clarify, please send us a pull request! For more on the tools used to write docs, please see the {doc}`/developers/documentation` section of the Developer Guide.

Please observe the following when writing documentation:

- Use American English spelling.
- Use examples when possible.
- Break up longer paragraphs.
- Use "double quotes" instead of 'single quotes'.
- Favor "and" (data and code) over slashes (data/code).

## Artwork

Surely we can put artistic talent to use. See <https://github.com/IQSS/chat.dataverse.org/issues/18> for a story about drawing animals chatting about Dataverse.

As [annnounced](https://groups.google.com/g/dataverse-community/c/pM39_9O5Rug/m/CK-gJqZFBgAJ), we have a [sticker template](https://dataverse.org/sites/projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/dataverseorg/files/dataverse_community_stickers_template.zip) you can use.

See [Illustrations from The Turing Way](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.3332807) for how that community has created artwork. Perhaps we can do the same.
