## Documentation

The source for the documentation is in the GitHub repo under the "[doc][]" folder. If you find a typo or inaccuracy or something to clarify, please send us a pull request! For more on the tools used to write docs, please see the {doc}`/developers/documentation` section of the Developer Guide.

Please observe the following when writing documentation:

- Use American English spelling.
- Use examples when possible.
- Break up longer paragraphs.
- Use "double quotes" instead of 'single quotes'.
- Favor "and" (data and code) over slashes (data/code).
